Merge Friends is a merge two title developed by Skunkworks. Development of the title started in May 2020, and it was one of the first few merge two titles released. Being one of the genre trailblazers enabled the studio to quickly scale the game during its soft launch phase (July 2020). The title got later on globally launched (March 2021) and has reached +1 million players.

One of my responsibilities in the project was developing features and content for the game, including Teams/Crews, Events, and VIP-pass features. However, given the small team size, I also built and managed the build pipelines for the Android and iOS platforms of the game client.
